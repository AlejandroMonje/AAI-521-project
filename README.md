<b>Prerequisites</b>
* First have either ```jupyter notebook``` installed and running (https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) 
* Create/Register for a ```kaggle accounnt```. You can register for an account here (https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?phase=emailRegister)

<b>Installation</b>
<br>
In order to run the code you will need the ```train.zip``` and ```test1.zip``` files which are provided in the repository. You may also obtain these files from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data (put those files into your working directory). Open the AAI_521_Group3.ipynb file. Your path may be different than ours so you will have to update the path in the follwing  sections: 
Once the path has been updated you should be able to run the rest of the cells in the in the file. You can run individual cells in jupyter notebook by pressing ```shift + enter``` or you can go to ```Cell``` and the hit ```Run All```. If you would like to change the specific image to test the image segmentation portion on you can update the variable ```file``` which is in the second cell of the _Classifying An Unseen Image Using Best Performing Model section.

<b>Project Objective</b>
<br>
The main purpose of this project is demonstrate our ability to create a machine learning model that takes in the images, classifies them, and lastly use the grabcut algorithm to perform image segmentation. The goal of this project is to have a model that can take in a dataset of images and accurately classify those images. In our case we used a dataset that consists of dog and cat images. We also want to to be able to perform image segmentation on these images. We can potentially use this

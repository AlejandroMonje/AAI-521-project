Image Segmentation 
This project is a part of the AAI-521 course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the
University of San Diego (USD).Â 
-- Project Status: Completed

<b>Prerequisites:</b>
* First have either jupyter notebook installed and running (https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) or use google colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) both are free resources that you can use to run our code on.
* kaggle accounnt: you can register for an account here (https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?phase=emailRegister)

<b>Installation</b>
In order to run the code in this repository you will first have to get the the train.zip and test1.zip files from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data and put those files into your working directory. Open the AAI_521_Group3.ipynb file. Your path may be different than ours so you will have to update the path in the follwing  sections: 
Once the path has been updated you should be able to run the rest of the cells in the in the file. If you would like to change the specific image to test the image segmentation portion on you can update the variable ```file``` which is in the second cell of the Classifying An Unseen Image Using Best Performing Model section.

<b>Project Objective:</b>
The main purpose of this project is demonstrate our ability to create a machine learning model that takes in the images, classifies them, and lastly use the grabcut algorithm to perform image segmentation. The goal of this project is to have a model that can take in a dataset of images and accurately classify those images. In our case we used a dataset that consists of dog and cat images. We also want to to be able to perform image segmentation on these images. We can potentially use this

Discuss the details of project overview. Description your selected dataset, such as data source,
number of variables, size of dataset, etc. Include data dictionary, if available. Provide questions
and hypothesis that you are exploring. What specific data analysis, visualization, and modeling
work are you using to solve the problem? What roadblocks and challenges are you facing? etc.
